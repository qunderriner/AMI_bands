# AMI_bands

AMI_Bands_Main_file_Cleanest-v5_Rent_Burdened.ipynb Has all the AMI data for the December 15th missing middle meeting (charts use relative percentages). 

AMI_Bands_Main_file_Cleanest-v6_absolute_numbers.ipynb has all the AMI data for the December 22nd missing middle meeting. Note, altair plots don't always render on github so you would 
have to rerun the code to see the documents presented in the meeting. 

Aux data folder has all of the data needed for crosswalks etc to make the files run 

2010-2019_ca_household_survey_v2.csv file is too big for github, but stored on box here: https://app.box.com/folder/128479057701
